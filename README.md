# ⏱️ Autocomplete Toggle – Take Control of Your Coding Flow

Ever feel like **autocomplete** is helping a bit *too much*?

This extension lets you easily **turn autocomplete on or off** right from the status bar in VS Code — and the best part? You can disable it for a **custom time**: 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, 3 hours, 5 hours, or any value you want.

> Sometimes we need to *think* before the machine jumps in with suggestions 😉

- Displays if autocomplete is **ON** or **OFF**.
